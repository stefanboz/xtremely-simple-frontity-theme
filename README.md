# xtremely-simple-frontity-theme

This repo contains a complete but very simple and basic custom Frontity theme. [Frontity](https://github.com/frontity/frontity) is a free and open source framework to develop WordPress themes based on ReactJS. It simply consumes Wordpress REST API and it's fun to work with. It uses Emotion, a CSS-in-JS solution. While not really being a fan of CSS-in-JS, I don't see it as a too much of an issue either.
